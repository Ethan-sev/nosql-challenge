# nosql-challenge
Had to use different AI learning like chatgpot and expert learning in order to help correct syntax error in my code. I also ran into a pretty big issue when trying to go into geocode and get my lat lon. 
Was able to figure all of the code out but not without some struggle. 
Hopefully this one has some more comments but I still need to work on making it much neater. It may help if I add a block to do scratchwork in while im going though the problem
